CONCLUSION
================================================================================

This comprehensive statistical analysis of the top 10 most popular cat breeds
reveals significant differences across health, physiological, and personality
characteristics. All measured traits showed statistically significant breed
differences (p < 0.001), with effect sizes ranging from medium to large.

Key insights include:
• Substantial variation in life expectancy (12.6-15.8 years) and weight (8.7-13.0 lbs)
• Breed-specific health risks, particularly PKD in Persians and HCM in Maine Coons
• Strong personality differences, especially in vocalization and affection levels
• Notable gender dimorphism in weight across all breeds
• Positive correlation between social needs and affection levels

These findings provide valuable insights for potential cat owners, breeders,
and veterinarians in understanding breed-specific characteristics and health risks.
